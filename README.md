PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The Training Management Portal is a web-based tool empowering training coordinators to efficiently organize and oversee courses, trainers, and training schedules. It allows the creation, editing, and removal of Courses, Student and Trainer details, along with scheduling, modification, and deletion of Training sessions. Administration can manage Course attributes like Name, Description, Category, and Trainer details including Name, Qualification, and Experience. The system ensures data integrity by preventing deletions when upcoming Trainings are scheduled and avoids duplicate Training schedules.
